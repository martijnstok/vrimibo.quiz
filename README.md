# Vrimibo Quiz
​
This project is in collaboration with Yeagger B.V. 
Yeagger is a startup company that wants to help other startups grow into the companies they want to be. They do this by providing an app for their customers where they will be able to sell their services.
​
Yeagger would like to have a quiz app for internal use. This quiz app will be used to hold quizzes during customer feedback but also just for fun on a friday evening.
​
Pointers Yeagger wants to achieve:
* The quiz app should have customisable content
* The quiz app should have a dashboard to create/delete this customisable content
* The quiz app should be somewhat real time
* The quiz app should give the users a competitive feel when answering questions
* The app must work on Android (iOS is optional)
